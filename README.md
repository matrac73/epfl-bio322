# Predicting Analyte Retention Times in Liquid Chromatography

This project is based on the kaggle competition Analyte Retention Time Prediction in Liquid Chromatography: https://www.kaggle.com/t/c0e55ecc6bf449ef811091d93c157fef. The goal is to predict the retention time of analytes (chemical substances) in liquid chromatography based on their molecular structure.

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
* `module.py` : This file contains all the definitions of the functions needed to clean, preprocess, split train and fine tune data and models.  
* `DataCleaning.ipynb` : 
* `Feature_Enrichment.ipynb` : 
* `Feature_Reduction.ipynb` : 
* `LinearRegression.ipynb` : 
* `Regularisation.ipynb` : 
* `RTPostProcessing.ipynb` : 

* `preprocessing.py` : This file loads and preprocesses the data, including cleaning, feature engineering, and splitting into training and test sets.
* `model_training.py` : This file trains and evaluates different machine learning models for predicting retention times, including linear methods with regularization and nonlinear methods.
* `results_comparison.py` : This file compares the performance of the different models and summarizes the results.
* `README.md`: This readme file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
To run the code, you will need to install the following dependencies:
`pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets

You can then run the following commands to load, preprocess, train, evaluate, and compare the models:

```
python data_preprocessing.py
python model_training.py
python results_comparison.py
````
